Peer Feedback:
- On your home page, the "Read More" link is broken.

- When your tiles on the team shop page go down to 2 to a row, 
  the calendar taking up the whole space on the bottom feels a little 
  out of place or like it would be a featured item. You could play 
  around with either a blank space to the left of the final item or an 
  additional box with purchase info or "more coming soon", so that 
  everything lines up. 

Fixes:
- I fixed the 'Read More' button by changing the link.
- I added an empty box so the calendar doesn't take up two spots when the browser is under 610px.
